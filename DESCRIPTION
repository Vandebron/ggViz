Description: 
    Shiny app to build `ggplot` visualizations using a UI that mimics the 
    layers of information used by the "Grammar of Graphics" approach. 
    The app is intended as a didactic tool, and can also be used to ease data
    visualization of csv or excel files in general.
    `ggplot` code employed to generate visualizations is made available, and the
    resulting plots can be downloaded.
